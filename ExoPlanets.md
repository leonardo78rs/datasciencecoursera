## ExoPlanets Version Zero.

# Astronomy:

Since 1996 it was confirmed several planets orbiting other stars in our galaxy.

Through the movement of the stars analysis (method of radial velocities) is determined indirectly orbital parameters of the translation of massive objects around a central star. These recent detections prove the existence of other planets beyond the Solar and may be a sign of life, intelligent or not, on other planets outside our solar system.

Solar models of planetary formation are used to discuss possible planetary systems features not displayed yet. From observations of the solar system and the development of new stars there are several theories to explain the formation of gaseous and rocky planets.
This work aims to organize and make a modeling of data from some planets through assumptions and comparisons with the solar system, and does not include all possibilities and not all planetary variables. Some important properties were not considered herein as pressure and high atmospheric, orbital eccentricity, axial tilt of the planet, latitude, and rotation.

# Data Science


Provide the study, thinking, and physical solutions to the proposed problem.
In this article I intend to use several data scientist tools as a way to enhance and share experience and knowledge.
In the first stage, choose some planets according to the mass and the distance to its star mother and perform some calculations, will have a lot of algebra and a small amount of data. Let's calculate the temperature of these planets, escape velocity and atmospheric composition. In this way we will be adding information to the pre-existing data collection.
All code is R.

The second stage will connect these codes R with dynamic data, drawn from official sites of astronomy. In this way you can automatically use the same modeling data to any planet of the official collection.

The third stage would be to focus on some of the specific studies in the process of detecting the planets, preferring to work with a large number of data.
